add SDL_mixer?
add SDL_ttf?
SDL_INIT init only things we really need
writing parser for settings file and save file and maybe replay
config file to load last resolution etc... on startup
move scenes out of core?
when changes res in settings, reload scenes (cause font needs to update in size which is handled in constructor)
